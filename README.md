# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Background Context

In this project, we aim to factorize numbers used to encrypt important documents. The challenge is to factorize these numbers as quickly as possible before the target fixes the bug on their server, allowing us to decode the encrypted documents[^1^][1].

## Requirements

- **Language**: You can choose any programming language of your choice[^2^][2].
- **OS**: Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS[^3^][3].

## Tasks
